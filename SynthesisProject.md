# AFDS Synthesis Project
###### (aka "_the best of good intentions_")

## Background
### Old Mark

I'm a small data biogeochemist. My main tools today have been:

* Data wrangle in Excel (urgh)
* Visualise in SigmaPlot (surprisingly good, until it crashes)
* Analyse on an ancient university laptop with an equally ancient version of SPSS (very urgh)
* Spectral analysis (e.g. MIR) reliant on expensive proprietory software requiring external expertise and vulnerable to change
* Molecular data increasingly important, but always an SEP (someone else's problem)
* Multivariate stats in [Primer-E](https://www.primer-e.com/our-software/primer-version-7/?currency=NZD) and [PERMANOVA+](http://www.primer-e.com/our-software/permanova-add-on/?currency=NZD) (surprisingly powerful and robust, only "urgh" is repeatability... and partially shoddy graphics)

* Be generally collegial in my both effort/data attribution, and try to leave data in a reasonable shape once a project is complete, but with no real thought on formal onward use by external parties


### New Mark ....or where new Mark needs to be

* Wrangle data of all shapes and sizes, repeatably, and with clear workflows for provenance
* Visualise data cleanly, often displaying many factors on the same figure, e.g. 
...![15N data](./outputs/Rplot03.pdf)
* Use clear, transparent and appropriate modern statistical techniques (e.g. properly designed mixed models tests) that are repeatable and portable between platforms (and not just 15 year old laptops running Windows XP)
* Be ab
* Have clear plans in place about where data will come from, what will happen to it, where it will go, how it can be used beyond the life of the project, and agreement over who should be attributed for what
