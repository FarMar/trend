## Background
### Old Mark

I'm a small data biogeochemist. My main tools today have been:

* Data wrangle in Excel (urgh)
* Visualise in SigmaPlot (surprisingly good, until it crashes)
* Analyse on an ancient university laptop with an equally ancient version of SPSS (very urgh)
* Spectral analysis (e.g. MIR) reliant on expensive proprietory software requiring external expertise and vulnerable to change
* Molecular data increasingly important, but always an SEP (someone else's problem)
* Multivariate stats in [Primer-E](https://www.primer-e.com/our-software/primer-version-7/?currency=NZD) and [PERMANOVA+](http://www.primer-e.com/our-software/permanova-add-on/?currency=NZD) (surprisingly powerful and robust, only "urgh" is repeatability... and partially shoddy graphics)

### New Mark ....or where new Mark needs to be

* Wrangle data of all shapes and sizes, repeatably, and with clear workflows for provenance
* Visualise data cleanly, often displaying many factors on the same figure, e.g.
