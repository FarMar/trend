# AFDS Synthesis project
###### (aka "_the best of good intentions_")

## Background
I'm a small data biogeochemist. My main tools today have been:

* Data wrangle in Excel (urgh)
* Visualise in SigmaPlot (surprisingly good, until it crashes)
* Analyse on an ancient university laptop with an equally ancient version of SPSS (very urgh)
* Multivariate stats in [Primer-E](https://www.primer-e.com/our-software/primer-version-7/?currency=NZD) and [PERMANOVA+](http://www.primer-e.com/our-software/permanova-add-on/?currency=NZD) (surprisingly powerful and robust, only "urgh" is repeatability... and partially shoddy graphics)
